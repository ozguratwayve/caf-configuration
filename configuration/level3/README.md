A landing zone for application is split between two levels. Level 3 includes components of an application that are typically delegated to platform operations teams.

The privileged infrastructure services: to support the application platform. This would usually include components like virtual network blocks, virtual network peering objects to hubs, route tables and delegated identities (to deploy level4 services and whenever applicable applications deployment credentials).
